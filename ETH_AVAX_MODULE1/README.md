# ErrorHandling Smart Contract

The `ErrorHandling` is a simple Solidity smart contract that demonstrates various error handling techniques in Solidity - `require()`, `revert()`, and `assert()`.

## Description

This contract includes three functions that perform basic arithmetic operations. Each function showcases a different error handling technique:

1. `addNumbers`: This function adds two numbers `a` and `b` together. Before returning the result, it uses the `require()` statement to check if `a` is greater than or equal to 5. If `a` is not greater than or equal to 5, the transaction will be reverted with the specified error message.

2. `subtractNumbers`: This function subtracts `b` from `a`. If `b` is greater than `a`, the function will explicitly revert with the specified error message using the `revert()` statement.

3. `multiplyNumbers`: This function multiplies two numbers `a` and `b`. It uses the `assert()` statement to check if `b` is greater than 0. If `b` is not greater than 0, the function will throw an assertion error.

## How to Use

1. Install Solidity Compiler: Ensure you have the Solidity compiler installed on your machine. You can find the installation instructions on the official Solidity documentation.

2. Compile the Smart Contract: Compile the `ErrorHandling.sol` smart contract using the Solidity compiler. You can use Remix, Truffle, or any other Solidity development environment to compile the contract.

3. Deploy the Smart Contract: Deploy the compiled smart contract to your desired Ethereum network. You can use Remix or other Ethereum development tools to deploy the contract.

4. Interact with the Contract: Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the various functions (`addNumbers`, `subtractNumbers`, `multiplyNumbers`) to observe the different error handling techniques. The contract will handle errors gracefully based on the conditions specified in each function.

5. Note: Error handling is crucial in smart contracts to ensure proper execution and prevent vulnerabilities. By using `require()`, `revert()`, and `assert()` statements appropriately, you can handle exceptional situations and ensure the safety and reliability of your smart contract.
